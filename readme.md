
**README: Tailored Resume Generator**

### **Project Overview**

This project is a specialized extension of the `lib_resume_builder_AIHawk` package ([https://github.com/feder-cr/lib_resume_builder_AIHawk](https://github.com/feder-cr/lib_resume_builder_AIHawk)). While the original package focuses on generating resumes from scratch, this application prioritizes tailoring your existing resume to specific job descriptions, ensuring optimal relevance and impact.

### **Key Features**

* **Enhanced Customization:** Provide your existing resume as input for highly personalized tailoring.
* **Focus on Relevance:**  Filter out irrelevant details and highlight the most pertinent experiences based on the job description.
* **Keyword Optimization:**  Strategically include keywords from the job description to boost visibility in Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
* **Simplified Workflow:**  A user-friendly Gradio interface streamlines the process for users of all technical backgrounds.

### **Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   * **`lib_resume_builder_AIHawk` Library:** Follow the installation instructions on the official project page ([https://github.com/feder-cr/lib_resume_builder_AIHawk](https://github.com/feder-cr/lib_resume_builder_AIHawk)) to install the `lib_resume_builder_AIHawk` library. This provides the core functionality for interacting with OpenAI's GPT models.
   * **YAML Configuration:**  For configuration details related to OpenAI API keys and other settings, refer to the well-documented YAML setup instructions in the  `Auto_Jobs_Applier_AIHawk` project ([https://github.com/feder-cr/Auto_Jobs_Applier_AIHawk](https://github.com/feder-cr/Auto_Jobs_Applier_AIHawk)). This project provides a solid foundation for understanding YAML configuration in this context.

2. **Installation:**
   * Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/tailored_resume_generator`
   * **Replace the `lib_resume_builder_AIHawk` Library:** Replace the `lib_resume_builder_AIHawk` library in this project with the cloned version from the official repository. This ensures you're using the most up-to-date version.
   * Install the additional project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Configuration:**
   * Create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key`

4. **Usage:**
   * Run the application: `python main.py`
   * The Gradio interface will open, prompting you to:
     * Upload your existing resume
     * Enter the job description
     * Choose an output file name
   * Click "Generate Resume" to create the tailored resume.

### **Why Keep the Same Name?**

Maintaining the same name as the original `lib_resume_builder_AIHawk` package demonstrates a clear connection and respect for the original project. It also helps users recognize the core functionality and understand that this project is a specialized extension, rather than a completely new concept.

### **How it Works**

1. **Resume Upload:** Share your existing resume as input, providing the foundation for personalization.
2. **Job Description Analysis:** The application extracts key requirements and keywords from the provided job description.
3. **Resume Enhancement:** Relevant sections within your resume are identified, and the content is tailored to match the extracted keywords and specific job description criteria.
4. **Output:** The enhanced and personalized resume is saved to your chosen output file name.
